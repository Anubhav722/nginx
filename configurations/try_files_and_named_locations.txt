try files and named locations


try files as with the return and rewrite directives can be used in the server context.
So applying to all incoming requests or inside a location context with try files allows us to do is have nginx check for a resource to respond worth in any number of locations relative to the root directory.

syntax:
```
try_files path1 path2 final;
```
final argument results in a rewrite and re-evaluation


named locations: assigning a location to a location context and using directives such as try_files. use that location by name.
