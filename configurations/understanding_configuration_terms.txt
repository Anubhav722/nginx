two main configuration terms is context and directives.

directies is specific configuration options that get set in the configuration files and consist of a name and a value.

context on the other hand is a section within a configuration where directives can be set for that given context.

context is the same as scope and like scope context is also nested and inherit from their parents with the topmost context simply being configuration file itself.


important contexts include the http context (for anything http related), server context (where we define a virtual host), location context (for incoming requests)
