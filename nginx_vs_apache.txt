Apache is configured in what's called a pre fork mode meaning that it has spawned a set number of processors each of which can serve a single request at a time regardless of whether that request is for appear to each script or an image.

Nginx on the otherhand deals with requests asynchronously meaning that a single nginx process can serve multiple requests concurrently basically just depending on the system resources.

nginx unlike apache can't embed server side programming languages into its own processes meaning that all requests for dynamic content has te be dealt by a completely separate process like PHP and then reverse proxy back to the client via nginx. 

nginx can:

1. serve static resources much faster than apache
2. can handle large number of concurrent requests.

nginx interprets incoming requests as URI locations whereas apache prefers to interpret requests as filesystem locations.
